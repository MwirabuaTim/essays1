var Essay_Writing = '\
\
    <p>The essay is one of the most prominent parts of <strong>academic writing,</strong> which tests students’ ability to represent an idea and build convincing research in theory to prove the central point of the subject. So while <strong>planning for an essay, </strong>students must take detailed research and a coherent structure into account to streamline information and help readers build credibility.</p>\
    <p>Detailed <strong>planning for an essay</strong> is an insurmountable idea to writing flawless<strong> </strong>essays, which, however, is given less importance over other major aspects leading to poor academic performances. <strong>Planning an essay</strong> requires details to your priorities with a provision to an argument in the most effective manner. It means essay writing depends on a quality essay writing plan from the beginning. &nbsp;</p>\
    <p>Poorly crafted essays are considered highly uncreative depicting a wrong impression. Hence to understand the basic nuances of<strong> essay writing plan </strong>to avoid discomfort, students must acknowledge some prominent genres of<strong> essay writing</strong> in detail, which in itself is a great <strong>essay writing help</strong>. But before going deep into details of<strong> essay writing </strong>genres, let’s understand the origins of “<strong>Essay Writing”</strong> and its definition.</p>\
    <h2>Understanding the Essay Writing</h2>\
    <p>The term “Essay” has been derived from the Latin verb <em>exigere</em>, which literally means to test and examine. And in general, an essay is a type of non-fictional modern English writing which requires a writer to follow a factual<strong> </strong>writing style based on research, detailed analysis, data, statistics, and other important facts. A writer pursues an<strong> </strong>argument in an essay, mostly, to prove a point or to direct attention to a particular subject with factual evidences in the most concise manner. Basically, an essay has a main subject which is discussed with the help of arguments and a number of facts.</p>\
    <p>To understand the flawless<strong> </strong>composition of essays, students are required to be familiar with 4 important genres of<strong> </strong>essay writing:</p>\
    <p><strong>Expository Essays</strong></p>\
    <p><strong>Descriptive Essays</strong></p>\
    <p><strong>Narrative Essays</strong></p>\
    <p><strong>Argumentative or Persuasive Essays</strong></p>\
    <h3>Expository Essay</h3>\
    <p>The expository essay is one of the primary genres of<strong> </strong>essay, which demands a different approach and a different <strong>essay writing plan </strong>altogether. It mainly revolves around an idea supported by evidences and facts to allow an examiner time to evaluate the credibility. The ideas are further expounded followed by establishing arguments concisely and a conclusion outlining the objective. The main features of successful<strong> </strong>expository essays comprise definitions, comparisons, contrast, <strong>essay writing plan</strong>, data, facts, and statistics that help students meet their objective in an effective manner.</p>\
    <p>Not just <strong>planning for an essay</strong> is important, but also the structure, which helps a reader to view your subject in a sophisticated manner. Let’s get the basic idea of how an expository essay<strong> </strong>is structured.</p>\
    <h4>Thesis Statement</h4>\
    <p>Students are required to understand the importance of concise thesis statement around which whole arguments are composed. This is precisely done to follow or receive the guidelines. Students are required to hone their skills in writing an effective<strong> </strong>thesis statement to avoid experience issues later in writing<strong> </strong>expository essay. Mastering the art of writing effective thesis statement is a rewarding <strong>essay writing help</strong> that a student can learn with time.</p>\
    <h4>The Transition</h4>\
    <p>There has to be a smooth transition between introduction, body, and conclusion like in other forms of writing. You allow readers to stray away from the main theme by failing to create a clear transition in your writing.</p>\
    <h4>The Body Paragraphs</h4>\
    <p>The ideal way to create an effective paragraph is to keeping it exposed to just one idea for more clarity, conciseness, and coherence. Mixing two or more ideas in a paragraph is a wrong practice that should be avoided.</p>\
    <h4>Statistical Evidence</h4>\
    <p>The<strong> </strong>expository essay doesn’t require too much statistical evidences. Hence exaggeration of unnecessary facts (whether factual, statistical, logical, and anecdotal) should be avoided.</p>\
    <h4>Creativity</h4>\
    <p>Students are often not considered to emphasize on creativity while creating<strong> </strong>expository essays. However, it’s creativity in itself to not allow creativity to take over while writing<strong> </strong>expository essays. The writing style must be kept formal, informative, and concise.</p>\
    <h4>The Conclusion</h4>\
    <p>The ‘conclusion’ part of writing probably has most number of misconceptions around. Remember, your conclusion must not restate the thesis but rather readdress the thesis by the help of evidence proven in the essay. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\
    <h4>Building the Argument</h4>\
    <p>There are times when students begin to write an argument successfully but fail to end it convincingly. It remains open leading to many questions and doubts throughout the essay. So the best approach while <strong>planning for essay writing</strong> is to choose a topic that can be debated on length and have answers to all rising questions. Your argument should neither start abruptly nor end abruptly. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\
    <h4>‘Five Paragraph’ Concept</h4>\
    <p>This is not mandatory writing format for<strong> </strong>expository essays; however, five-paragraph concept for<strong> </strong>expository essay<strong> </strong>writing is a standard approach for some in many ways which gives great results. It is an ideal approach comprising an introduction paragraph, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion.</p>\
    <h3>Descriptive Essays</h3>\
    <p>As the name suggests itself, descriptive essays are integral genres of essay writing, which demand a student to include extra attention to his/her <strong>essay writing plan</strong> and, accordingly, describe various features such as the central objective, the main theme, the people, the experience, and the emotions etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\
    <p>Unlike other genres of<strong> </strong>essay writing, descriptive essays offer students a creative freedom to deal a particular subject in an artistic manner by describing in detail and leaving a clear impression of the objective. Descriptive essays follow a well-versed form of <strong>essay writing plan</strong> coupled with a detailed analysis on the subject. After studying some quality <strong>descriptive essay examples </strong>in detail, we get to know that students have used the opportunity of creative freedom to take their writing to describing essential aspects of a descriptive essay. Hence students <strong>planning for an essay</strong> on descriptive genre must take some time out to study some quality descriptive <strong>essay writing examples</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\
    <p><strong>Let’s read some guidelines to writing descriptive essays:</strong></p>\
    <h4>Essay Writing Plan for Descriptive Genre</h4>\
    <p><strong>Planning an essay</strong> based on descriptive genre is a vital feature of <strong>writing a descriptive essay</strong>, which must leave a clear impression of a particular subject in the mind of the examiner with the detailed idea of the main theme. For example, if you are required to describe a particular destination in your essay, then you must accumulate ideas before you start describing the place. For instance, if you wish to describe New York, you can start writing about it by accumulating related words: America, U.S.A, North America, Population, Modern, Monuments, Cultural, etc. Now start compiling your ideas to get the description of the destination.</p>\
    <h4>The Language</h4>\
    <p>It’s important to use the right language while <strong>writing a descriptive essay</strong>. Using the right language is about ensuring the right words are used in the most effective manner. The language and the words should be relevant and highly informative.</p>\
    <h4>The Words</h4>\
    <p>Choosing the right words is an essential feature of any <strong>essay writing plan</strong>, but there are times when students don’t pay attention to choosing the right word particularly. There are many synonyms of particular words that, in terms of effectiveness and information, discuss better and help examiners build a clear picture. For example, don’t write <em>cheap</em> when you can use <em>Miserly</em> instead. Don’t use <em>not sufficient</em> when you can use <em>insufficient</em>. Such effective use of words offer conciseness while <strong>writing a descriptive essay</strong>.</p>\
    <h4>The Six-Senses</h4>\
    <p>The readers must experience how a particular object smells, tastes, looks, sounds, etc. This is how you must describe a particular subject in <strong>descriptive essays </strong>allowing a reader to use their all six-senses.</p>\
    <h4>Emotional Connect</h4>\
    <p>Express an emotion to get connected to the reader. In fact by studying some of the quality descriptive essay writing examples, we realize that students have used expression of emotions as a medium to connect to the readers. So it is always an effective approach to build a connection with the examiner. Divulge extra light on areas where you have scope to express an emotion.</p>\
    <h4>The Impression of Descriptive Writing</h4>\
    <p>Describe everything in a way that your readers start believing you. For example, if you are describing <em>pizza </em>in your descriptive essay, the reader must feel like having one there and then.</p>\
    <h4>Organization</h4>\
    <p>Your descriptive essay should be organized letting examiners to get the right impression of your subject. Your description has to be in order including your facts, emotions, and other ideas. The moment you fail to create coherence, you lose your readers.</p>\
    <h3>Narrative Essay</h3>\
    <p>Narrative essay follows the pattern of story narration, which is an essential part of narrative <strong>essay writing plan</strong>. Narrative style is often anecdotal, experiential, and personal which offers students an ample opportunity to design their essays in a creative way. Narrative essays are popular style of essay writing which help students express their subjects in a creative way. They have freedom to be creative until they follow the narrative pattern of essay writing.</p>\
    <h4>The Parts of Narrative Essay</h4>\
    <p>As mentioned earlier, the narrative essays follow a pattern of story narration, which means they are written in a story style. So it is important to have all essential parts of the story in your writing such as introduction, characters, the plot, setting, climax, and, of course, conclusion.</p>\
    <h4>Understanding When to Use the Pattern of Story Telling in Narrative Essay</h4>\
    <p>It is true that most of the times narrative essays are written using story telling pattern, but not necessarily all the time a student is required to follow the same pattern. The story telling pattern is applied to particular themes or subjects. So when not to use the story-telling pattern in narrative essays? You must understand the subject first, whether it will be appropriate to deal a subject with story-telling pattern or not. If you are writing a book report, then better keep your narrative essay informative, concise, and formal.</p>\
    <h4>Serve the Purpose</h4>\
    <p>Undeniably, every type of writing revolves around a purpose which is studied during initial stages of an <strong>essay writing plan</strong>. But there are times when poorly crafted pieces of writing fail to clearly evoke a purpose leading a reader into thinking whether there was any purpose in the first place. So first get a clear concrete purpose and write to serve it effectively.</p>\
    <h4>The Point of View</h4>\
    <p>You should select the right point of view in narrative essays. Many students, in many cases, tend to follow author’s ‘standpoint of view’, which is a wrong practice. Hence, students should also explore their point of view in writing for better results. It is in fact important if the student is expecting to connect to the reader.</p>\
    <h4>The Clear Language</h4>\
    <p>The clear language is important in narrative essays because students tend get complicated in their writing due to freedom of story-narration style and overindulgence of this style. Narration offers creative freedom but it still demands clarity in thoughts. Be creative but not at the expense of clear ideas and concrete impressions.</p>\
    <h4>Freedom to Write in ‘First-Person’</h4>\
    <p>Although writing in first person is allowed and acceptable, students must never overdo it. Students must not use it unnecessarily and try not to use first-person if it complicates your ideas. It is better to stick to third-person writing style as far as possible.</p>\
    <h4>The Order of the Thoughts and Ideas</h4>\
    <p>Your narrative essay must be in order starting with an impressive introduction, clearly stating the purpose of the essay. The body and the conclusion have to be coherent ending with the satisfaction of meeting the purpose. You must have control over your essay and it must show in your writing.</p>\
    <h3>Argumentative Essay or Persuasive Essay</h3>\
    <p>Argumentative essay is an important part of essay writing, which requires intensive research and detailed <strong>essay writing plan</strong>. After studying a number of quality <strong>argumentative essay samples, </strong>it becomes clear that the main objective of argumentative essay is to investigate a topic methodically with proven facts and evidences.&nbsp;</p>\
    <p>However, students seeking an effective <strong>essay writing help</strong>, first must understand the difference between argumentative (persuasive) and expository writing to have a clear picture of what argumentative writing truly is. It’s been found that most students confuse argumentative writing with expository writing, which undeniably has similar features. Comparing the <strong>argumentative essay samples</strong> and expository writing samples, we find the amount of research done for argumentative writing is too intense and vast than done for expository writing. Expository essays are generally short in length and demand less research.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\
    <p>To help students get the best <strong>essay writing help</strong> in writing argumentative essay, we have compiled a list of major features of composing an argumentative essay. Let’s read them in detail:</p>\
    <h4>The Significance of the First Paragraph</h4>\
    <p>The first paragraph of argumentative essay must set the tone and context of the theme giving readers a fair idea about the work. Secondly, the author must shed light on why topic is important to be even considered for attention by readers. At the end, authors have to represent an effective thesis statement written intelligently to help readers follow the guidelines. Writing an effective thesis statement is a great <strong>essay writing help</strong> which comes with hours of practice and effective <strong>essay writing plan</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\
    <h4>The Clear Transition</h4>\
    <p>As an argumentative essay is comprised of vast research and analysis, the transition through the writing tends to get slightly complicated after some time. However, no matter how vast research is, author must maintain a smooth transition between paragraphs, Title, summary, introduction, body, and conclusion. You can have good research but if you cannot develop or progress your thoughts effectively in the essay, then your efforts are wasted. The structure for your argument must not collapse anytime.</p>\
    <h4>Body Paragraphing and Facts</h4>\
    <p>Effective paragraph creation is important and keeping one idea to one paragraph is the key. The discussion in the paragraph must have some sort of connection with the opening statement to help readers experience the transition while switching to new paragraphs. It will help them not stray from the main theme. Argumentative essay must include some paragraphs expounding the conflicting opinions rather than proving them wrong straight away. Every opinion and discussion must have relevancy or else they won’t make readers stick or sense the reliability.</p>\
    <h4>Detailed Support to Thesis Statement</h4>\
    <p>The argumentative essay must be accurately supported by facts (whether factual, logical, statistical, or anecdotal) to support the main theme of the essay. There has to be various points of view to support the thesis statement to help readers get a fair idea of the subject with multiple choices to evaluate.</p>\
    <h4>The Conclusion</h4>\
    <p>Despite knowing that the ‘conclusion’ is an important part of an argumentative essay, students pay very little attention to writing it. The conclusion of an argumentative essay must re-discuss the thesis in the light of evidences.</p>\
    <h4>Considering It as ‘One-on-One Debate’</h4>\
    <p>The best idea to write an argumentative essay is to take it as a ‘one-on-one debate’ with somebody. You can pick any topic and provide it a structure. It must raise questions but have convincing answers to not reiterate the same question again. It must complete at the end leaving to no more questions, doubts, and answers.</p>\
    <h4>Argumentative Essay as Five-Paragraph Essay</h4>\
    <p>This is not a mandatory format for argumentative essay at all, but still if approached with this five-paragraph mindset, it offers better result. It may be longer than just five paragraphs depending on the research, analysis, and facts. Five-Paragraph approach helps authors to design their arguments effectively with an introduction, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion.</p>\
    <p>The aforementioned ideas and tips on essay writing<strong> </strong>will help attain accuracy in your writing. The objective of introducing these standards principles of essay writing is to help students explore other approaches of writing in an effective manner. The best <strong>essay writing help </strong>is to bring yourself to a level where you begin to relate with an idea from various concepts.</p>\
